#  Banking Management System (Java, OOP)

### Class Order (My Preferred Sequence):

1. UserInformation.java
2. Account.java
3. Transaction.java
4. Bank.java
5. SecurityManager.java
6. DataStorage.java
7. BankingManagementSystemMainMethod.java

##  Description
This is a console-based **Banking Management System** developed in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It allows users to create accounts, manage their bank accounts, perform transactions, and securely store data through file handling. The system emphasizes modular design, data integrity, and user-friendly operation.


##  Features

-  User creation and login verification  
-  Account management (create, deposit, withdraw, check balance)  
-  Transaction processing (transfer money between accounts)  
-  Displaying all accounts and details  
-  Password change feature  
-  Exception handling (invalid inputs, login errors, duplicate data)  
-  File management (save and load user data)


##  OOP Concepts Used

- **Encapsulation**: Properties are kept private and accessed using getters/setters  
- **Inheritance**: Promotes code reuse and better structure  
- **Polymorphism**: Uses method overloading and overriding for flexibility  
- **Abstraction**: Simplifies complex logic and hides internal implementation


##  Technologies Used

- **Language**: Java  
- **IDE**: NetBeans  
- **Database**: File system (Java File I/O used for saving data)
