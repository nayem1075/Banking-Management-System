# Banking Management System (Java, OOP, GUI)

## Class Order (My Preferred Sequence):

UserInformation.java
Account.ava
Transaction.java
Bank.java
SecurityManager.java
DataStorageManager.java
Main.java

## Description
This is a Banking Management System built in Java, applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles along with a graphical user interface (GUI) using JFrame. The system allows users to create accounts, manage their bank accounts, perform transactions, and securely store data through file handling. The GUI provides a user-friendly experience while the system ensures modular design and data integrity.

## Features
- User registration and login verification
- Account management (create account, deposit, withdraw, check balance)
- Transaction processing (transfer money between accounts)
- Display all accounts and their details
- Password change functionality
- Robust exception handling (invalid inputs, login errors, duplicates)
- Persistent data storage using Java File I/O

## OOP Concepts Used
Encapsulation — Private fields with getters/setters
Inheritance — Promotes code reuse and better design
Polymorphism — Method overloading and overriding
Abstraction — Hides complex logic and internal details

## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Java
GUI: Swing (JFrame)
IDE: NetBeans
Data Storage: File system (using Java File I/O)

## How to Run
Clone the repository:
https://github.com/nayem1075/Banking-Management-System                                                                                     
Open the project in NetBeans or any Java IDE that supports Swing GUI.
Run Main.java to start the Banking Management System with GUI.

## About Me
I’m Nayem Uddin, a Computer Science and Engineering student.
I built this Banking Management System during my 2nd semester as part of my practice to improve my understanding of Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

At the time, I had just learned the basics of Java and wanted to build something real using what I knew. This project helped me learn a lot — from how classes and objects work to how to handle files and even how to build a simple user interface using JFrame.
